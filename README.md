The website serves as a portfolio showcasing the work of a full-stack developer, with a focus on skills, used technologies, and client testimonials. It also includes a feedback form, contact information, and various interactive elements.

## Technologies Used:
## Frontend: HTML, CSS, Animate.css, JavaScript, Axios
## Dependencies: accordion-js, axios, izitoast, swiper
## Tools: VSCode, Figma, Git/GitHub

This project demonstrates our ability to effectively apply JavaScript, using various libraries to improve the site's functionality and animations. We implemented anchor links for easy navigation and added animations to create a dynamic user experience. Using Axios, we efficiently managed form submissions and received responses in the form of a modal window.

The result is a fully functional and polished portfolio website, which is the product of collaborative team work.
